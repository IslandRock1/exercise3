# AIS2203 - Exercise3

The exercise is about reading information from an XML file in C++ and displaying it in a nicely formatted way. To do this, you need to:


* Use a library to read and understand the XML file (_pugixml_).
* Use another library to print the information in a clear, styled format (_fmt_).

__Make sure your project is set up so these libraries are available and work correctly on your computer.__

The main goal is to practice using external libraries in C++ and to see how to get data from a file and show it to the user in a readable way.
